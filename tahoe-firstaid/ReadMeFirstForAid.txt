Tahoe-FirstAid

This is aimed to make the installation of Tahoe-LAFS 1.10.0

easier only this version will need it.

Tahoe-Lafs 1.10.1 will be hopefully easier to install on windows.

Follow this steps:
unpack the WinLAFS-FirstAidKit
copy the tahoe-firstaid directory to the base directory of tahoe-lafs 
place tahoe-firstaid.zip in a unused new home directory of tahoe-lafs
it is the directory with the file Tahoe.home
and unzip it on this place
cange to tahoe-firstaid directory and dubleclick install(.bat)

This will copy the file  _auto_deps.py 
in the ..\src\allmydata\ directory

Windows user may ask WinLAFS for more help.
